# crickyclockalarm

This is my first GitHub repository, so forgive me if I didn't set this up correctly.

Anyways, this is an alarm clock that I made with Python. The idea is that you can put in a playlist and it will choose a random song so you don't get sick of the song that you have set.

You can make new playlists as .txt files; add a link to a song on each line. The defaule playlist is "songs" and you don't have to add the '.txt' extension in the gui.

The lastinfo.txt file saves the time and playlist from the last time that you use the alarm clock (eg: you don't have to set it to the same time every night, only if you want a different time or playlist).
